One of Lem’s major recurring themes, beginning from his very first
novel, The Man from Mars\index{book}{The Man from Mars}, was the
impossibility\index{problems}{impossibility} of communication between
profoundly alien beings\index{problems}{aliens}, which may have no
common ground with human intelligence\index{problems}{human intelligence},
and humans\index{problems}{humans}. The best known
example is the living planetary ocean\index{problems}{living ocean}
in Lem’s novel Solaris\index{book}{Solaris}. Other examples include
swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible),
\index{book}{The Invincible} and strangely ordered societies
of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing the failure
of the first contact\index{problems}{contact}. In His Master’s Voice,
\index{book}{His Master’s Voice} Lem describes the failure of
humanity’s intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent
message\index{problems}{message} from space. Two overlapping arcs
of short stories, Fables for Robots\index{book}{Fables for Robots}
(Bajki Robotów), translated in the collection Mortal Engines), and
The Cyberiad\index{book}{Cyberiad} (Cyberiada) provide a commentary
on humanity in the form of a series of grotesque, humorous,
fairytale-like short stories about a mechanical universe inhabited
by robots\index{problems}{robot} (who have occasional contact with
biological "slimies" and human "palefaces").
