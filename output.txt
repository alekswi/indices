One of Lem’s major recurring themes, beginning from his very first
novel, The Man from Mars, was the
impossibility of communication between
profoundly alien beings, which may have no
common ground with human intelligence,
and humans. The best known
example is the living planetary ocean
in Lem’s novel Solaris. Other examples include
swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible),
and strangely ordered societies
of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing the failure
of the first contact. In His Master’s Voice,
Lem describes the failure of
humanity’s intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent
message from space. Two overlapping arcs
of short stories, Fables for Robots
(Bajki Robotów), translated in the collection Mortal Engines), and
The Cyberiad (Cyberiada) provide a commentary
on humanity in the form of a series of grotesque, humorous,
fairytale-like short stories about a mechanical universe inhabited
by robots (who have occasional contact with
biological "slimies" and human "palefaces").
